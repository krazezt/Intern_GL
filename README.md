# A 2D game, using the Megaman character but with completely different gameplay. Created for Gameloft intern project.

## Note that this is Megamad, not Megaman =))

## You can take a look at the features and gameplay by viewing the Slide.pptx file, that is my present slide.

## To build and play, please follow these steps:
